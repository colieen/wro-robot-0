A few shapes were considered for the gears linking the motor's small axle and our 3D-printed axle.


## Main linking gear

An extension was needed to fit onto both the motor's axle and 3d-printed axle snugly and ensure both axles turned with each other. Options for the shape of this extension ranged from hexagons (like hex screws) to gears with many teeth. For the outer shape, we settled on a 4-point star-shaped gear based halfway between a Phillips and a Torx head. This shape was easy to model and had walls that were almost perpendicular to the turning motion, resulting in a very low chance of camming out.

For the inner shape, we followed the cross-sectional shape of the motor's axle. This was done by using a circle and introducing a chord in the circle to make the flat sides of the axle. Many rounds of trial and error were neeeded to perfectly match the size of the motor. Initially, a 5.2mm diameter circle with a 3.5mm wide top fit perfectly, but after a few weeks of laser cutting, we needed to adjust the diameter to 5.05mm and the width of the top to 3.4mm.

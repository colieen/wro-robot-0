## Back Axle Design
When designing the whole robot, we realised that the current motor that we were utilising had a very small diameter. However, the 3D printer was too imprecise to print a hole shaped like it, and thus we had to print new axles to extend the small axle of the motor by creating a hexagonal-shaped sleeve around the original axle. Therefore, we had to laser cut a gear that linked the motor's small axle and our larger axle sleeve together (see laser-cutting-models -> discussion.md). The wheels would then go on the ends of the large axles, which created a system for the motor to turn both wheels about the axles.

## Back wheels Design
Initially, our back wheels were the wheels that came with the kit that we bought along with the vehicle chassis. However, these wheels were meant to fit with the original small axle of the motor, and could not fit with our larger custom axle. Hence, we made these wheels the same size as the original wheels in diameter (66mm), while also adding a hexagonal-shaped hole at the very centre of the wheel, big enough to fit the back axle into the wheel. We also decided to 3D print the wheel to be 15mm in width, as it was the perfect size to allow the wheels to have just enough friction to drive the vehicle forward. 

## Front Axle Design
One of the considerations we took when designing the axle was that the axle could not be too small, such that the axle connecting the wheels would be too thin and weak to hold up the vehicle. The axle had to be firm enough to withstand the weight of the vehicle, while also not being too heavy, which might affect the vehicle's ability to turn. 

Thus, we designed the axle to be a 3D-printed cylinder with a 20% infill density, which ensured that the axle was thick and strong enough to withstand the weight of the vehicle. Additionally, we also designed the axle to have a diameter of 10mm to fit the ball bearings into the axle. 

The axle was also designed to be 100mm in length, which was decided after multiple rounds of testing. This ensured that the wheels were not too far apart and that the wheels and axles could be turned by the servo motor, while ensuring that the axle was not too long to reduce the required moment needed to turn the wheels.

## Front wheels Design
When designing the front wheels, we took into account the ball bearings, which had to be incorporated into the front wheels, allowing the front wheels to spin freely without rotating the axle, which was attached to the servo.

When designing the wheels, one of the key features that the wheel had to contain was that the front wheels needed to be large enough but not too large to fit the ball bearings into the wheels, as the ball bearings would allow the wheel to spin freely and we also wanted the ball bearings to be secured into the wheels without dropping out or moving around as much. Thus, we decided to design the wheels to have a circular hole at the centre measuring 22.2mm in diameter and 15 mm in width. This allowed the ball bearings to fit nicely into the front wheels of the car without movement.

For the wheel itself, while we were testing out different prints of wheels of different dimensions, we discovered that the servo was not able to turn at first, as the wheels were too large and heavy, preventing the servo from turning the vehicle left and right. We then realised that the front wheels had to be light so that they would allow the servo to be able to turn the axle to turn the wheels without much difficulty. 

Therefore, we designed the wheels to be 50mm in diameter and 25mm in width for the outer frame, with about 20% infill density, so that it would be able to maintain its shape while also being as light as possible, making the turning process smoother. We also decided to use PLA as the material for the wheels, as it was lightweight and easy to print.

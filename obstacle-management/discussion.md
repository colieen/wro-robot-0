# Obstacle Management

## Ultrasonic Sensor
The ultrasonic sensor will send out pulses of ultrasonic waves when power is supplied to the ultrasonic sensor and record the time when it sends the ultrasonic waves. When the ultrasonic waves hit an object, it reflects towards the ultrasonic sensor, and the ultrasonic sensor will then receive the pulses of ultrasonic waves and record the time when it received the ultrasonic waves, and calculate the total time taken for the ultrasonic waves to travel from the vehicle's ultrasonic sensor to the object and back and use the formula above to determine an approximate distance of the vehicle from the object. Within the code, there is a certain threshold value, which is the maximum distance that the vehicle can be from the object. If the distance between the vehicle and the object is less than this threshold value, then the vehicle will steer to the left or to the right depending on the colour of the block.
